## Introduction

RTLoc is an evolutionary, real-time earthquake location technique
based on an equal differential time (EDT) formulation and a
probabilistic approach for describing the hypocenter estimation.

The algorithm, at each timestep, relies on the information from
triggered arrivals and not-yet-triggered stations. With just one
recorded arrival, the hypocentral location is constrained by the
Voronoi cell around the first triggering station constructed using
the travel times to the not-yet-triggered stations.

With two or more triggered arrivals, the location is constrained
by the intersection of the volume defined by the Voronoi cells for
the remaining, not-yet-triggered stations and the EDT surfaces
between all pairs of triggered arrivals.

As time passes and more triggers become available, the evolutionary
location converges to a standard EDT location.


## Compiling and Installing

RTLoc is written in pure C, without any external library dependence.
It can be compiled by a C or C++ compiler.

To compile, edit the `Makefile` by selecting the installation prefix
and the compiler executable, then run:

    make

and, optionally,

    make install

in case you want to copy the executable to your prefix path.

`Grid2Time` program from Anthony Lomax (part of the [NonLinLoc]
suite) is required to generate traveltime grids.

Plotting routines are written in Python and require [matplotlib].

## Usage

See `doc/usage.md` for usage instructions.


## Testing the code

A complete text case is available in the `testrun/` directory.
See `testrun/README.md` for instructions on how to run the test.


## Important Note

This is a research implementation of the code, with no actual
real-time capabilities.

Feel free to pick the relevant parts of this (GPL licensed) code
and build your own real-time module!

A real-time implementation of RTLoc --which processes continuous
seedlink streams-- is available within [PRESTo], a free and open
source software platform for Earthquake Early Warning developed
at the [RISSC-Lab], Naples, Italy.
